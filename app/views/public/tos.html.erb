<p><span style="font-style:italic">Entire Agreement</span>. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and GroupBuilder and governs your use of GroupBuilder, superseding any prior version of this TOS between you and GroupBuilder with respect to GroupBuilder.

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Waiver and Severability of Terms</span>. The failure of GroupBuilder to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
