## Welcome MeetingMaster


Social and fraternal organizations have clubs.

* Clubs have members.
* Members have meetings.
* Meetings have roles/duties.
* Members should volunteer for these roles...
* ...but they don't
* ...or they don't do so consistently
* ...or they don't do so in a timely fashion, leaving roles unfilled until the meeting starts


MeetingMaster solves these problems by assigning roles to members for meetings.

More specifically, MeetingMaster:


* Allows an individual to enroll a club, making the person who enrolls the club a 'club admin'
* Allows club admins to add other members to their club
* Sends email to members as they're added by the admin, inviting them to register with MeetingMaster. Note that the member need not actually register with MeetingMaster in order to be assigned meeting roles/duties. 
Provides the ability of members to register future periods of absence so they will not be assigned a role for any meetings while they're away.
* Provides the club admin to designate additional club admins.
* Allows club admins to create meeting schedule.
* Allows club admins to define meeting roles.
* Allows for meeting meeting roles to have a 'minimum experience level' required to perform the role.
* Generates role assignments for meetings which have unfilled roles and utilizes absence and role-experience data prevent the assignment of roles to individuals who will be away or who do not have the minimum required experience to perform the duties.
* Allows club admins to designate the frequency of automatic email communications to reminder members of their upcoming role assignments.
* Allows club members to request to swap role assignments within or across meetings provided they both consent to the trade.
