A new club will have 

- a "regular" meeting type
- an agenda definition created for it, but not the agenda itself
   (NOTE:  Need to code the link to not fail or to add a bare-bones agenda) 
- When adding roles, the default action is to add the role associated to the default meeting type but to easily change it
  to associate the role with multiple meeting types.

  A meeting should not, however REQUIRE roles. Example, officers meeting.


  Meeting --> should have a type
  Meeting --> should have an agenda
  Agenda --> May or may
